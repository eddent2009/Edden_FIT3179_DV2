    <h2>What is Water Fluoridation?</h2>
    <p>
      Water fluoridation is the addition of fluoride to public drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. 
      Fluoride strengthens tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay, and is commonly added to water supplies as a public health measure, 
      particularly to reduce cavities in children.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fluoridated:</strong> Fluoride is added to the water supply to meet health recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Fluoride:</strong> Fluoride is naturally present in the water without additions.</li>
      <li><strong>Partly Fluoridated:</strong> Some areas have fluoridated water while others do not.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Fluoridated:</strong> No fluoride is added to the water supply.</li>
    </ul>

        This treemap shows the distribution of suburbs managed by different water companies in Victoria. 
        Each rectangle represents a water company, with the size of each rectangle proportional to the number of suburbs it manages.
        Larger rectangles represent companies managing more suburbs, such as Yarra Valley Water and Barwon Water, while smaller ones represent companies like Coliban Water and Lower Murray Water.

      This map visualizes the fluoridation levels across different suburbs in Victoria. Each point represents a suburb, and the color coding indicates whether the water is fluoridated (Blue), naturally fluoridated (Green), not fluoridated (Red), or partly fluoridated (Orange).
