  <h1>Fluoridation Status in Victoria</h1>

  <h2>What is Water Fluoridation?</h2>
  <p>
    Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay.
    Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, strengthens tooth enamel, making teeth more resistant to decay. Many communities add fluoride to their water 
    supply as a public health initiative to reduce cavities, especially in children.
    The levels of fluoride are categorized into 4 parts:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fluoridated:</strong> Fluoride is added to the water supply to meet health recommendations for preventing tooth decay.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Fluoride:</strong> Fluoride is naturally present in the water, without any artificial additions.</li>
    <li><strong>Partly Fluoridated:</strong> Some areas within a region have fluoridated water, while others do not.</li>
    <li><strong>Not Fluoridated:</strong> No fluoride is added to the water supply in this region.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Treemap Section -->
  <h2>Treemap: Fluoridation by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="treemap"></div>
  <p>
    This treemap shows the distribution of suburbs managed by different water companies. Each rectangle represents a water company, and its size is proportional to the number of suburbs they manage.
  </p>

  <!-- Map Visualization Section -->
  <h2>Map Visualization: Fluoridation Levels by Suburb in Victoria</h2>
  <div id="pointmap"></div>
  <p>
    This map visualizes the fluoridation levels across different suburbs in Victoria. Each point represents a suburb, and the color coding 
    indicates the fluoridation level (Fluoridated, Natural Fluoride, Not Fluoridated, Partly Fluoridated). 
    This helps highlight regional differences in water fluoridation practices across the state.
  </p>

  <!-- Bar Chart -->
  <div class="chart-container">
    <h2>Bar Chart: Count of Suburbs by Fluoridation Level</h2>
    <div id="barchart"></div>
  </div>

  <!-- Stacked Bar Chart -->
  <div class="chart-container">
    <h2>Stacked Bar Chart: Fluoridation Status by Water Company</h2>
    <div id="stackbar"></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    The bar chart provides a breakdown of the number of suburbs for each fluoridation level. The stacked bar chart shows the distribution of fluoridation levels across different water companies.
