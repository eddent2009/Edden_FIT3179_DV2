    <h2>What is Water Fluoridation?</h2>
    <p>
      Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay. 
      Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, strengthens tooth enamel, making teeth more resistant to decay. 
      Many communities add fluoride to their water supply as a public health initiative to reduce cavities, 
      especially in children.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fluoridated:</strong> Fluoride is added to the water supply to meet health recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Fluoride:</strong> Fluoride is naturally present in the water without additions.</li>
      <li><strong>Partly Fluoridated:</strong> Some areas have fluoridated water while others do not.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Fluoridated:</strong> No fluoride is added to the water supply.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Treemap Section -->

  <h2>Treemap: Fluoridation by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="treemap"></div>
<div class="content">
  <p>
    This treemap shows the distribution of suburbs managed by different water companies in Victoria. 
    Each rectangle represents a water company, with the size of each rectangle proportional to the number of suburbs it manages. 
    The larger the rectangle, the more suburbs a company serves. For example, companies like Yarra Valley Water and Barwon Water manage more suburbs compared to 
    smaller water companies like Coliban Water or Lower Murray Water.

<!-- Map Visualization Section -->

  <h2>Map Visualization: Fluoridation Levels by Suburb in Victoria</h2>
  <div id="pointmap"></div>

  <p>
    This map visualizes the fluoridation levels across different suburbs in Victoria. Each point represents a 
    suburb, and the color coding indicates whether the water is fluoridated(Blue), naturally fluoridated(Green), not 
    fluoridated(Red) and partly fluoridated(Orange). Users can zoom in to explore the specific fluoridation details for each suburb.

<!-- Bar Chart -->

  <h2>Bar Chart: Count of Suburbs by Fluoridation Level</h2>
  <div id="barchart"></div>
<div class="content">
  <p>
  The bar chart shows the number of suburbs for each fluoridation level. The stacked bar chart highlights 
  how fluoridation levels vary across different water companies.

<!-- Stacked Bar Chart -->
  <h2>Stacked Bar Chart: Fluoridation Status by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="stackbar"></div>

<div class="content">
