  <h1>Data Visualisation 2</h1>

  <h2>Fluoridation Status in Victoria: A Comprehensive Data Visualization</h2>
  
  <!-- Pie Chart Section (Now First) -->
  <h2>Pie Chart: Fluoridation by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="piechart"></div>
  <p>
    This pie chart shows the distribution of suburbs managed by various water companies and the status of their fluoridation. 
    The size of each slice represents the number of suburbs managed by each water company. Hover over the chart to see the suburb count for each company.
  </p>

  <!-- Map Visualization Section -->
  <h2>Map Visualization: Fluoridation Levels by Suburb in Victoria</h2>
  <div id="pointmap"></div>
  <p>
    This map visualizes the fluoridation levels across different suburbs in Victoria. Each point represents a suburb, and the color coding 
    indicates the fluoridation level (Fluoridated, Natural Fluoride, Not Fluoridated, Partly Fluoridated). 
    This helps highlight regional differences in water fluoridation practices across the state.
  </p>

  <!-- Scatter Plot Section -->
  <h2>Scatter Plot: Suburbs by Latitude and Longitude</h2>
  <div id="scatter"></div>
  <p>
    This scatter plot displays the geographical spread of suburbs based on their latitude and longitude. 
    The color represents the fluoridation level, allowing us to see the geographic patterns of fluoridation practices. 
    The scatter plot also allows you to interactively explore how the fluoridation levels vary across Victoria.
  </p>

  <!-- Bar Chart Section -->
  <h2>Bar Chart: Count of Suburbs by Fluoridation Level</h2>
  <div id="barchart"></div>
  <p>
    This bar chart provides a breakdown of the number of suburbs for each fluoridation level. It categorizes the suburbs based on whether their water 
    is fluoridated, naturally fluoridated, not fluoridated, or partly fluoridated. This chart gives a clear overview of how widespread different fluoridation levels are across the region.
  </p>

  <!-- Stacked Bar Chart Section -->
  <h2>Stacked Bar Chart: Fluoridation Status by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="stackbar"></div>
  <p>
    This stacked bar chart shows the distribution of fluoridation levels across different water companies. 
    Each bar represents a water company, and the colors within the bar indicate the number of suburbs served by the company under each fluoridation level. 
    This visualization highlights which companies manage more fluoridated or non-fluoridated suburbs.
