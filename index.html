  <h1>Fluoridation Status in Victoria</h1>

<div class="content">
  <h2>What is Water Fluoridation?</h2>
  <p>
    Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to public drinking water to prevent tooth decay. 
    Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, strengthens tooth enamel, making teeth more resistant to decay. 
    Many communities add fluoride to their water supply as a public health initiative to reduce cavities, 
    especially in children.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fluoridated:</strong> Fluoride is added to the water supply to meet health recommendations.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural Fluoride:</strong> Fluoride is naturally present in the water without additions.</li>
    <li><strong>Partly Fluoridated:</strong> Some areas have fluoridated water while others do not.</li>
    <li><strong>Not Fluoridated:</strong> No fluoride is added to the water supply.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<!-- Treemap Section -->
<div class="content">
  <h2>Treemap: Fluoridation by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="treemap"></div>
  <p>
    This treemap shows the distribution of suburbs managed by different water companies. Each rectangle 
    represents a water company, and its size is proportional to the number of suburbs they manage.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Map Visualization Section -->
<div class="content">
  <h2>Map Visualization: Fluoridation Levels by Suburb in Victoria</h2>
  <div id="pointmap"></div>
  <p>
    This map visualizes the fluoridation levels across different suburbs in Victoria. Each point represents a 
    suburb, and the color coding indicates whether the water is fluoridated, naturally fluoridated, or not 
    fluoridated.
  </p>
</div>

<!-- Bar Chart -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>Bar Chart: Count of Suburbs by Fluoridation Level</h2>
  <div id="barchart"></div>
</div>

<!-- Stacked Bar Chart -->
<div class="chart-container">
  <h2>Stacked Bar Chart: Fluoridation Status by Water Company</h2>
  <div id="stackbar"></div>
</div>
<p>
  The bar chart shows the number of suburbs for each fluoridation level. The stacked bar chart highlights 
  how fluoridation levels vary across different water companies.
